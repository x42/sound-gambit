.PP
This utility processes a given input file applying a digital peak
look\-ahead limiter, constraining the output level to the given
threshold.
.PP
The target file will have the same properties (sample\-rate, channels,
bit\-depth) as the source file, and file meta\-data is copied.
The algorithm does not work in\-place. Input and Output files must be distinct.
Reading via standard\-I/O is supported, use '\-' as file\-name.
.PP
Prior to processing, additional input\-gain can be applied. The allowed
range is \fB\-10\fR to +30 dB.
.PP
When auto\-gain is enabled, input\-gain is relative to the given threshold,
and specifies the amount of effective gain\-reduction to be applied.
If input\-gain is zero, the file is only normalized to the given threshold.
.PP
The threshold range is \fB\-10\fR to 0 dBFS, and the limiter will not allow a
single sample above this level.
.PP
The release\-time can be set from 1 ms to 1 second. The limiter allows
short release times even on signals that contain high level low frequency
signals. Any gain reduction caused by those will have an automatically
extended hold time in order to avoid the limiter following the shape of
the waveform and create excessive distortion. Short superimposed peaks
will still have the release time as set by this control.
.PP
The algorithm is based on Fons Adriaensen's zita\-audiotools.
