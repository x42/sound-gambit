.PP
This utility processes a given input file applying a digital peak
look\-ahead limiter. Constraining the output level to the given
threshold.
.PP
The target file will have the properties (sample\-rate, channels,
bit\-depth) as the source file.
.PP
Prior to processing additional input\-gain can be applied. The allowed
range is \fB\-10\fR to +30 dB.
.PP
The threshold range is \fB\-10\fR to 0 dBFS, and limiter will not allow a single
sample above this level.
.PP
The release\-time can be set from 1 ms to 1 second. The limiter allows
short release times even on signals that contain high level low frequency
signals. Any gain reduction caused by those will have an automatically
extended hold time in order to avoid the limiter following the shape of
the waveform and create excessive distortion. Short superimposed peaks
will still have the release time as set by this control.
.PP
The algorithm is based on Fons Adriaensen's zita\-audiotools.
